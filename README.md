# EWs
1."zhao.code9-colombia.Pertussis.R" is to estimate Rt and EWs(earlier warming singnals).
2."estimateRe function.R" is function, which is needed to run before runing "zhao.code9-colombia.Pertussis.R". 
3."split.each.disease.each.country.R" is code that I use it to split each diseae in each country (i.e., one diesease csv file for each country/regoion). This procedure has finished.
